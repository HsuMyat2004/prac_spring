AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is one of the most popular programming concepts in Spring Core.
As the name suggests, AOP focuses on cross-cutting concerns—functionality that affects multiple parts
of an application, such as logging, security, and transactions, without being part of the core business logic.

OOP is powerful, but it can lead to problems like code scattering (same code repeated in many places)
and code tangling (business logic mixed with non-functional code like logging).
To clearly separate business logic (functional code) from non-functional code (e.g., logging), developers use AOP.

In many modules, we often need to inspect or apply concerns such as logging, security, or transaction management.
AOP is best suited for handling these requirements in a clean and centralized way.

 ************ Core Concepts of AOP ************

There are three main concepts to remember:

1. Pointcut
→ Defines which methods should be intercepted (where the action applies).

2. Advice
→ Defines what action should be taken and when it should run.
Types of advice:
    1.Before
    2.After
    3.After Returning
    4.After Throwing
    5.Around

3. JoinPoint
→ Represents the execution of a method (the point where advice is applied).

***** Proxy Mechanism in Spring AOP *****

Spring AOP works using proxies:

1. JDK Dynamic Proxy
→ Used by default when the target class implements an interface.
we can use a point cut with keyword both "target" and "this" for interface
but we can only use point cut "target" for class (impl)

2. CGLIB Proxy
→ Used when the target class does not implement an interface.
we can use point cut with both "target" and "this" for impl class without interface
